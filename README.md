<h1>Binary Classification using a Convolutional Neural Networkl</h1>

This is a simple model that classifies automobiles and aircrafts with around 95% accuracy that uses the CIFAR-10 dataset.
<br>
I also designed a simple interface where the user can input their own images to test with this model.

<ul><h2>Technologies used</h2>
<li>Python + Pytorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib</li>
<li>JavaScript + JQuery, Ajax</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>HTML,CSS</li>
</ul>

The model is already trained and the state-dictionary is saved.
